Practice Questions for PSU Proficiency Demos


This repo is intended to help students practice for the PSU proficiency demos for CS163 / CS202.

there will be practice questions that give the description of the question followed by the prototype.

``make clean``
    will update questions.cpp with questions from questions.txt
